# Projet Event Listener

## What
Have you ever searched for tech related events but couldn't find a platform gathering it all ? Well that's the issue that motivated this platform. eventListener is the apotheosis of the 5 months trainig program kind of like a final exam. This project was brought to life by a team of 4 developers and we had 1 month to go as far as we could. Then, there was a live demonstration of the app on Twitch.
